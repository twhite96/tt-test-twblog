This post will be really short[^1] but my team, the fine folks at Calaxy, are allowing me to write about the things I am learning, about the team, contributing to open source projects, as well as building prototype apps on my own time and they _**will pay me for it**_ which is just... _wild_.

So you'll see more from me after almost a year plus of radio silence.

And I'll write more about Calaxy in an upcoming post.

## Till then...

Have a good week! ðŸ¥³


[^1]: It is almost 1AM and I am exhausted after wasting my weekend on college football and baseball, in that order. ðŸ˜´
